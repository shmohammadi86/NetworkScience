1) ABOUT

This is the program MSGSTEINER, a tool for solving the Prize-Collecting Steiner
Tree problem on Graphs.

MSGSTEINER is based on Max-Sum and is an implementation of the ideas in M.
Bailly-Bechet, C. Borgs, A. Braunstein, J. Chayes, A. Dagkessamanskaia, J.-M.
Fran√ßois, and R. Zecchina. Finding undetected protein associations in cell
signaling by belief propagation PNAS published ahead of print December 27,
2010, doi:10.1073/pnas.1004751108

2) COMPILATION

You need to install boost libraries (www.boost.org). Just type 'make'.

3) USAGE

See ./msgsteiner --help for usage. 

You probably need:

-d <depth>  for the maximum depth of the tree
-t <it> maximum number of iterations
-o to see the final tree

You often need:
-r <real> noise parameter (should be small compared to weights and prizes: this is needed to break degeneracy)
-g <real> reinforcement parameter (small numbers normally give better solutions but with longer convergence times)

4) EXAMPLE

./msgsteiner -d 5 -t 100 -o -r 1e-5 -g .0001 < example.stp > tree.txt

where example.stp is in a generalized .stp format consiting on following lines:

E i j wij : link between i and j with weight wij
W i ci : vertex i with weight ci
R i : root is i (only one per .stp file)

E.g. :

E 1 2 .3
E 2 3 .4
E 2 4 .2
E 4 1 .7
W 1 .4
W 2 .5
W 4 .8
R 1
